## Parallel loops

A counted `from` loop marked `#[parallel]` runs its iterations at once. The
checker proves every write is private to its iteration (indexed by the loop
variable) and that nothing reads another iteration's write, so the loop is safe
to run, and to reverse, in any order.

```rust
fn axpy(a: &mut [i64; 1000], b: &[i64; 1000], i: &mut i64, k: &i64) {
    #[parallel]
    from i == 0 { a[i] += b[i] * k; } loop { i += 1; } until i == 999;
}
```

A bare `#[parallel]` lets the compiler pick CPU threads or a GPU. It estimates
each device as the slower of arithmetic and memory traffic plus a fixed launch
cost, with constants measured on an Apple M4. On that machine the CPU wins for
streaming loops and for light arithmetic; the GPU wins once a loop does enough
64-bit integer work per element (about 50 dependent multiply-adds and up). `#[parallel(cpu)]`, `#[parallel(metal)]` and
`#[parallel(nvptx)]` pin a target. Adjacent loops with the same iteration space
fuse into one loop (one GPU kernel) when the merged body is still safe.

## Building

```
roop build prog.roop --link main.c -o prog
```

`Roop.toml` configures it. Remove a target to opt out of it, or set
`auto = false` so a bare `#[parallel]` always means CPU threads:

```toml
[parallel]
auto = true
targets = ["cpu", "metal", "nvptx"]
```

Metal kernels are emitted as AIR and built with Apple's `metal` tools; NVPTX
kernels go through LLVM's PTX backend and need a CUDA driver at run time. The
CUDA launcher has not yet run on NVIDIA hardware.
